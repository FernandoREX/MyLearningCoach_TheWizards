# Presentation of the proposed solution
Due to the global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, education underwent a great change due to the sanitary restrictions that prevented face-to-face classes, this caused that in Mexico in the 2019-2020 school year approximately 33.6 million students enrolled in between the ages of 3 and 29 had to go from a face-to-face modality to a distance modality.

The information we have shows that in the three years between 2019 and 2021, the progress being made in trying to eliminate this educational bias is practically nil.

For these reasons, the development of a free and easily accessible educational platform has been proposed, with the aim of strengthening knowledge in the areas of science, technology, mathematics, engineering, art (STEAM), languages, etc., for all primary and secondary students, reducing the educational bias that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused in Mexico.

## Goal:

Develop a free, easily accessible and highly usable educational platform so that primary and secondary students can strengthen their knowledge in subjects such as mathematics, natural sciences, languages, etc. Using current technologies to counteract educational backwardness, especially due to the pandemic. Providing analytics per user for teacher use/knowledge would be a plus.

## Deliverables:

## Azure security
The identity and access layer controls access to the infrastructure and changes control.
The edge layer uses Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection to filter out large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users.
The network layer limits communication between resources through access controls and segmentation.
The compute layer protects access to virtual machines.
The application layer helps ensure that applications are secure and free from security vulnerabilities.
The data layer controls access to business and customer data that needs to be protected.
Access roles

Supervisor
Teacher
Tutor
Father or mother (Teacher to validate)

## Justification of the solution
Education is one of the pillars in the development of society, due to the pandemic that we have faced in recent years and the problems that it brought to our daily lives, not to mention other aspects, due to this this activity has had to go through many changes, in the first instance the suspension of classes in their face-to-face modality, the same ones to which most of the students were accustomed, the subsequent resumption in virtual format and the need to use the different information and communication technologies (ICT). s), which many, including students, teachers and even parents, were not used to using or did not have access to.
This situation highlighted the importance of ICTs in the academic training of students from the basic levels, incorporating them as a tool to support education. Gradually, schools have begun to get used to the so-called "new normality", students and teachers have begun to return to classrooms and with this they seek to adapt and continue with teaching and learning, however, despite efforts to continue with teaching it has been detected that a large part of the student body has been affected due to the problems involved in changing from one modality to another, as well as due to the lack of tools and access to educational material, leaving as a result a lag in most of the student population, which leads to learning problems, delay in the topics covered in class, low grades, failure and even dropout.

For these reasons we can see that there is a clear need to have at hand a tool that helps us combat this lag that has caused an important bias in terms of student learning, mainly at the basic and middle-basic education levels, that is, primary and secondary. We see ourselves in a situation in which a tool is required that is helpful both for reviewing topics for the regularization of students, where they make use of technology so that they continue to familiarize themselves with it, and that at the same time is of free access for students and that it is available to as many of them as possible.
The Wizards proposes a project whose proposal is based on an educational platform in which the parents or guardians of one or more students can create an account with the respective profiles of each student so that they have access to educational material, which will be provided by accredited teachers within the platform, corresponding to their level and school grade or to the one they seek to reinforce. The content will be organized in levels, these in grades and the grades in turn in the various subjects found in the study plan according to the SEP. In the same way, the student will be able to contact a tutor, who will be a university student, who will help him with the issues or exercises that are more complex.
It has been decided to develop this platform through a web application, this to make it available to the largest possible population since they will be able to access it through the internet from a greater number of devices, including mobiles.
This project offers a study tool in which students will find material according to their needs, which will combat the lag resulting from the pandemic and prevent possible desertion, in addition to continuing to learn to use ICTs and develop more relevant skills. to the use of technology. In addition to this, the parents or guardians of the students will be able to have control and knowledge of their performance, in order to be aware of their needs and achievements. Being the education of future generations as important as it is for social development, we put on the table this project that can be used as a support instrument, hand in hand with the Ministry of Public Education and primary and secondary schools for academic development. of its students, thus reducing the bias present in education and directly combating one of the main causes of school dropout after the pandemic.
